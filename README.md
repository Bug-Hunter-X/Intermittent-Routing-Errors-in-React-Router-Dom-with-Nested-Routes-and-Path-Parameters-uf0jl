# React Router Dom Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using nested routes and path parameters in React Router Dom. The issue involves unexpected routing behavior where the route matching does not function as expected, resulting in incorrect component rendering or navigation problems.

## Problem Description

The primary challenge is the inconsistency of the error. It is intermittent and does not occur reliably, making it difficult to debug and reproduce consistently. This makes it challenging to identify the root cause or implement a consistent solution.  The application seems to randomly render the wrong component or fail to navigate to the correct route, even with seemingly correct path definitions.

## Steps to Reproduce

While consistent reproduction is difficult, the issue tends to manifest more frequently under conditions of high load or rapid navigation between routes.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Navigate between routes repeatedly to attempt to trigger the routing issue.

## Solution

The solution is outlined in the `bugSolution.js` file, explaining the approach used to address the problem. Note that this solution involved a deeper analysis of the React Router configuration and state management. The issue may be related to how the router handles updates to the URL, particularly in situations involving multiple simultaneous updates or race conditions.
